## Overview

### Description

The application allows students to order food for delivery on campus
and have it picked up and delivered by another student while
optimizing convenience for both students.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

- **Category:** Delivery/Food
- **Mobile:** The app is suited for mobile use since it gives users
  easy access to order/deliver food while on the go
- **Story:** Delivery apps are expensive. Delivery people have to go
  out of their way to go to a resturant, pick up food, and deliver it
  to a different location. There is wasted opportunity with students
  on a college campus. Students are able to deliver to one another
  with less hassle, as they are more likely to share usual locations.
- **Market:** This app would be targeted towards college students
  looking for cheaper delivery and also students looking to make extra
  money without much effort.
- **Habit:** Students looking to deliver would open the app whenever
  they are at a resturant. They would input where they are headed
  after leaving the resturant, and indicate they are open to picking
  up food. Students looking to order, can either open their app or be
  notified when a student is willing to deliver to their location. If
  a deliverer and an orderer are matched, they can communicate through
  temporary chat.
- **Scope:** The core features of this application is being able to
  match two students for food delivery. The basic version would allow
  students to input locations and able-to-deliver status. It wwill
  also allow the students to communicate through chat. Once the core
  features are implemented, the app will be extended to make the
  matching process more fluid and require less user input and chat.
